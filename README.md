# COMP.CS.300 - Data structures and algorithms 

This repository contains project made for University course Data Structures
And Algorithms 1. Part 1 of the project is excluded, since part 2 only extends
on the part 1 and adds functionality on top of it.

This repository contains **datastructures** class which was implemented by me. Rest of the files were implemented by professor of the course. Datastructures class uses several algorithms such as DFS, BFS, A* and combines them with different data structures. Efficiency of implemented algorithms and functions was estimated by using well known O, Omega
and Theta efficiency approximations. Program is implemented in C++ and also uses ready, well-made STL.

Building and running project with Qt Creator is fairly trivial. I recommend using Qt Creator if interested in running the program. Just open ``.pro`` file with Qt Creator and ``Run`` the project. If using test files, remember that you may need to choose appropriate Build path in Qt Creator (prg2).
